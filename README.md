# Product Recommendation Engine
Problem: Given the transactionâ€™s day of month, day of week,
part of day, channel, and first item(s) the customer already has in the
shopping cart, predict for each product item the probability that the customer later purchases it and use the prediction to recommend products.

* Develop a prototype recommendation engine by:
    * training a machine learning model for the prediction task
    * creating a post-processing logic to generate product recommendations
    * Provide analysis of predictive accuracy and characteristics of the developed recommendation engine
